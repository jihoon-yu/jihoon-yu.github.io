          다양한 동료들과 이야기 나누면서,사용자 중심의 재미있는 아이디어를
          찾아내는 것을 좋아합니다. 좋은 디자인은 제품을 아름답게 만드는 수단이
          아니라 제품과 브랜드의 가치가 담겨있는 것이라고 생각합니다.
          타이포그래피와 레이아웃, 컬러의 조화를 바탕으로 단순하고 직관적인
          디자인을 추구하며, 이를 위해서 새로운 기술, 다른 분야, 문화를 학습하는
          것에 매우 적극적입니다.

        Over a long period of time, services, projects, and functions that need
        to be opened have increased, which is inconsistent for users. It came to
        provide an uncomfortable experience. To solve this, we tried to solve it
        based on a clear UX design and a UI design with principles.

        The Seoul Store is basically designed based on 3 Dept, including menus,
        detail pages, and actual action pages such as payment. The menu and the
        detail page are organically connected, and users can always quickly
        access the action page to achieve what they want.

        In order to reorganize product details and lists, the most important
        issue was to think about how to clearly convey various information. To
        this end, the importance of information was classified when designing a
        product list and detailed product, and designed based on the information
        hierarchy of the order of product price, brand, label, and review.

        The amount of issuance of friend discount codes that exploded at the
        beginning of the opening decreased significantly over time, As new
        services opened, we identified the problem with the conclusion that the
        accessibility of the friend's discount code was inferior. In order to
        reactivate the friend discount code, which is the main service, we
        boldly conducted a test to expose it in the form of a floating button at
        the bottom of the home and the top of My Page.

      <div class="seoulstore-project-detail-text">
        Based on the fact that users show high click-through rates to famous
        brands, we designed a structure in which major brands are placed at the
        top, single at the bottom, and then themes.

        As the promotion structure was reorganized, the image communication
        method was also newly improved. In order to increase the visibility of
        the brand, the brand logo was directly exposed, and the theme and
        product were also improved with a card image to effectively convey
        information.

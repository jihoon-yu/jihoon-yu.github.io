          현대인들은 충동적인 구매를 유도하는 자극적인 광고와 마케팅에 둘러싸여
          생활하고 있습니다. 이러한 충동구매는 현대인들이 소비를 밑바탕으로 한
          잘못된 보상심리와 만족감에 중독되게 하고, 궁극적으로 올바르지 못한
          소비습관을 형성하도록 만들고 있습니다. ‘버킷리스트’라는 단어에서
          아이디어를 얻어, 사람들이 저마다 마음속에 지니고 있는, 충동구매를
          자극하는 버킷 상품들을 찾고, 계획적인 저축을 통해 보상받을 수 있도록
          도와주는 서비스를 제안하고, 현대인들에게 올바른 소비습관을 형성하는데
          도움을 주고자 합니다.

      In order to reorganize product details and lists, the most important issue
      was to think about how to clearly convey various information. To this end,
      the importance of information was classified when designing a product list
      and detailed product, and designed based on the information hierarchy of
      the order of product price, brand, label, and review.

      In Bucket Home, users can check the price of the bucket item they want and
      information about the accumulated (saved) amount at a glance. In addition,
      you can view your account and accumulation status by scrolling left and
      right, and you can perform tasks such as bucket alarm, bucket addition,
      and account addition without moving the page.

      The bucket addition process was configured as simply as possible to
      prevent a dropout rate in the process of using the service. In addition,
      it was intended to encourage users to write the purpose and reason for
      purchasing the bucket, and to deliver a specific saving plan at the last
      stage, thereby stimulating users' earning motivation.

      The process of adding a bucket account is also designed to be as simple as
      possible with the user flow, It is designed so that users can quickly
      access and select their accounts through each bank authentication
      certificate authentication step.

      I wanted to design the bucket app and bucket product information to be
      easily and quickly accessible so that users can easily be motivated to
      keep planned savings. For this purpose, it was designed as a way to
      utilize the basic functions of iPhone, Quick Action and Widgets.

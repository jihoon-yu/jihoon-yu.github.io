### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and weâ€™ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

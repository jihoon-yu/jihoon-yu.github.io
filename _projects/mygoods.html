          커머스 시장의 환경은 유튜브 채널의 파급력이 커지고, 크리에이터와의
          협업이 중요해지고 있습니다. 마이굿즈 프로젝트는 '연결된 관계를
          가치있게 하자'라는 미션이 현재 시장 환경에 부합하고, 크리에이터 고유의
          표현이 들어간 굿즈를 제작, 판매 할 수 있는 서비스가 많지 않다는 문제를
          파악하여 해결하기 위해 진행한 프로젝트입니다.

        My goods service is the second service of D Unit and is operated in
        conjunction with the Seoul Store. To deliver the same brand experience
        as the Seoul Store, logos and applications were created using the brand
        elements of the Seoul Store BX 2.0 Guide.

      My Goods is designed to be divided into 3 parts LNB, search & menu bar at
      the top, and content area for convenient usability. Users can move through
      the LNB and menu bar located at any depth and page, and the accessibility
      has been increased to make goods easier.

    <div class="mygoods-project-detail-text">
      The custom tool is one of the parts that I paid the most attention to when
      designing My Goods. Intuitive icons and text guides were used so that
      general users and creators would have no difficulty in using them, and we
      focused on providing consistent visuals even if the functions of each
      custom tool are completely different.

    <div class="mygoods-project-detail-text">
      In addition to custom tools, the process of designing the flow of making
      goods directly was very challenging. The screen was divided into 3 parts,
      showing the guide on the production stage on the left, the view area where
      you can directly see the goods being made in the middle, and the custom
      tools required for production on the right. In addition, for convenient
      expression during production, various resources such as fonts, images, and
      stickers are provided in advance to enhance usability.

      The My Goods Store is an essential element of the My Goods project. We
      designed the profile image and store main image to be customizable for
      creators' free expression, and designed affordance to the follow button so
      that creators and fans can maintain a relationship with each other.

    <div class="mygoods-project-detail-text">
      Creators can receive the sales amount excluding commissions based on the
      sales history of goods. The settlement system must expose various
      information such as the amount that can be settled, the number of sales,
      and the total amount of settlement that occur during settlement. When
      designing, we focused on expressing this information clearly.
